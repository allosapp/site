        <p>Resonance frequency breathing is a simple, effective way to bring your body and mind back into balance and to help you increase your resilience to stress. As with any new exercise, it is recommended that you consult your doctor before beginning a breathing practice.</p>
        <h2 class="article-h2"><strong>How to Practice Resonance Frequency Breathing:</strong></h2>
        <p>You can practice resonance frequency breathing in any position—sitting, lying down, or even standing up. This type of breathing can be very relaxing and can make you sleepy, so it’s best not to practice it while driving a car or operating dangerous machinery.</p>
        <h3>1. Practice normal breathing:</h3>
        <p>If you are new to slow-paced breathing or resonance frequency breathing, we recommend that you take the time to practice slowing your breathing down before jumping right in to resonance frequency breathing. Check out <a href="/slow-paced-breathing/guide-to-slow-paced-breathing" target="_blank"><strong>A Practical Guide to Slow-Paced Breathing</strong></a> to learn more about the mechanics of breathing and how to practice slowing your breathing.</p>
        <h3>2. <strong>Practice breathing with a pacer</strong></h3>
        <p>After slowing the pace of your breathing down, try breathing with the pacer. A good place to start if you are trying this for the first time is at 8 breaths per minute and work down from there. If 8 breaths per minute still feels too slow, practice on your own, slowing your breathing down as much as you feel comfortable. It will get easier with practice.</p>
        <h3>3. <strong>Resonance frequency assessment</strong></h3>
        <p>If you know your resonance frequency, you can start breathing at this rate by setting the pacer in the breath settings. If you don’t know your resonance frequency, you can determine it by taking an assessment. The Allos Breath Pacer will include a feature for assessing your resonance frequency. For now, there are many free HRV apps, like HRV4Biofeedback and EliteHRV, which include assessments for finding your resonance frequency. Once you have determined your resonance frequency, you can use the Allos Breath Pacer to practice resonance frequency breathing any time. Just set the breath timing for your resonance frequency breathing rate and enjoy your favorite content customized perfectly for your RF rate.</p>
        <h3>4. <strong>Resonance frequency breathing without an assessment</strong>:</h3>
        <p>If you don’t know your specific resonance frequency, you can still benefit from a slow-paced breathing practice. Most people have a resonance frequency of around 5.5-6 breaths per minute and research supports the benefits of breathing at this rate even if your rate is a little different.</p>
        <h3>5. Have fun!</h3>
        <p>Learning a new practice can be challenging, like learning to ride a bike. If you get to distracted by the details of paying attention to your breathing, then step back and follow you own instincts and just breathe naturally. In time, you will learn to relax and enjoy the movement and rhythms of your own body. You can always adjust the pacer to whatever breathing rate feels most comfortable for you in your current state.</p>
