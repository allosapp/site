title: What is Resonance Frequency Breathing?
description: Resonance frequency breathing is an exercise that synchronizes natural rhythms of the body by breathing at a specific rate, usually between 4.5 and 7 breaths per minute, and takes advantage of the unique physiological properties of the cardiovascular system.

        <p>Resonance frequency breathing, also called ‘resonance breathing,’ ‘resonant breathing,’ or ‘coherent breathing,’ is a breathing exercise that synchronizes natural rhythms of the body. It involves breathing at a specific breathing rate, which for most people is around 5.5 to 6 breaths per minute, and takes advantage of the unique physiological properties of the cardiovascular system. Breathing at one’s resonance frequency can enhance the natural, healthy oscillations of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems.</p>
        <p>Your resonance frequency is determined by a test that involves breathing at a range of slow breathing rates while using a heart monitor to measure changes in your heart rate, also known as heart rate variability, or HRV. Your resonance frequency is the breathing rate that results in the highest heart rate variability. This rate differs slightly between individuals but is usually between 4.5 and 7 breaths per minute. While it is most effective to determine one’s resonance frequency with a heart rate monitor and software that can analyze HRV, many of the benefits of resonance frequency breathing can be obtained simply by breathing at a slow, regular rate of 5.5 or 6 breaths per minute.</p>
