        <p>Slow-paced breathing is a simple and effective way to bring the body and mind into balance and to help us strengthen our resilience to stress. As with any new exercise, it is recommended that you consult your doctor before beginning a breathing practice.</p>
        <h2 class="artiicle-h2">Stress and Breathing</h2>
        <p>When we get stressed or anxious, we often tense up, which can affect the way we breathe. Holding extra tension in the muscles we use to breathe limits their movement, so we compensate by using other muscles to breathe, like the ones in our shoulders and neck. This type of breathing tends to be shallow and rapid, only moving air in and out of the upper chest. It can also disrupt the natural balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in our body.</p>
        <p>When we slow our breathing down and breathe into our abdomen and lower chest, we enhance our natural breathing movement. A regular practice of slow breathing can help establish an awareness of normal breathing patterns and help us identify when we are holding tension in our bodies and limiting our breathing.</p>
        <h2 class="artiicle-h2">How to Practice Slow-Paced Breathing</h2>
        <p>You can practice slow breathing in any position—sitting, lying down, or even standing up. This type of breathing can be very relaxing and can make you sleepy, so it’s best not to practice it while driving a car or operating dangerous machinery.</p>
        <h3>1. Practice normal breathing first:</h3>
        <p>To start, relax your limbs and imagine your spine lengthening to support the movement of your ribcage and abdomen. Breathe naturally, inhaling and exhaling through your nose. As you inhale, feel your belly and lower ribcage expanding outwards, away from the center, then feel them drawing back in towards the center on the exhale. Let this movement happen naturally, making sure to exhale for as long as you need until you feel the urge to inhale.</p>
        <h3>2. Don’t breathe too much air:</h3>
        <p>When you first start breathing more into the belly and lower ribcage, you may feel dizziness. This usually means you are breathing too much air, so try to reduce the movement slightly so you are not inhaling so much air.</p>
        <h3>3. Slow down your breathing:</h3>
        <p>When you are comfortable with this feeling of natural breathing, try slowing down the rhythm slightly. Many people find that it is easier to slow your breathing down when there is a little resistance, so if you’re having trouble extending the exhale, try gently pushing the air out through pursed lips, as if you are blowing out a small candle.</p>
        <h3>4. Breathe with a pacer:</h3>
        <p>After slowing the pace of your breathing down, try breathing with the pacer. A good place to start if you are trying this for the first time is at 8 breaths per minute and work down from there. If 8 breaths per minute still feels too slow, practice on your own, slowing your breathing down as much as you feel comfortable. It will get easier with practice.</p>
        <h3>5. Have fun!</h3>
        <p>Learning a new practice can be challenging, like learning to ride a bike. If you get too distracted by the details of paying attention to your breathing, then step back and follow you own instincts and just breathe naturally. In time, you will learn to relax and enjoy the movement and rhythms of your own body. You can always adjust the pacer to whatever breathing rate feels most comfortable for you in your current state.</p>
