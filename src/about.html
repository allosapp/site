        <p>The <strong>Allos Breath Pacer</strong> is an audio/visual pacer for slow-paced breathing exercises like resonance frequency breathing.</p>
        <p>Breathing practices have been around for millennia in many forms and in many cultures. Recently, scientific research has begun to confirm the reported benefits of certain breathing practices for maintaining and improving both mental and physical health. Studies have shown that it is possible for us to change our physiology, including our mental state, by making adjustments to the way we breathe.</p>
        <p>One type of breathing exercise that has been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety, increasing resilience to stress, and restoring balance to the nervous system is the practice of “slow-paced breathing.” Slow-paced breathing generally refers to breathing at a regular rate that is slower than the normal rate of breathing. “Resonance breathing” or “resonance frequency breathing” is a form of slow-paced breathing using the specific breathing rate that elicits the greatest variability in one's heart rate (also known as heart rate variability or HRV). For most individuals, this rate is around 6 breaths per minute.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Allos Breath Pacer</strong> was developed specifically for the practice of slow paced breathing and resonance frequency breathing. The app offers a wide variety of audio and visual content and lets you curate your own collection of paced music, soundscapes, and animated video to use as a guide for your own customized breathing practice.</p>
        <p>We create our own custom-generated content to appeal to many different audiences so that you can craft unique experiences for different moods and styles of practice. Our soundscapes range from soft tones and nature sounds to rhythmic beats and classical music, and our animated visual images draw from many graphic styles and forms of generative art.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Allos Breath Pacer</strong> will be available soon for iOS and Android devices.</p>
