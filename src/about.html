        <p>The <strong>Allos Breath Pacer</strong> is a music-guided pacer for slow breathing exercises like coherent breathing (also known as "resonance frequency breathing").</p>
        <p>Breathing practices have been around for millennia in many forms and in many cultures. Research has begun to confirm the reported benefits of certain breathing practices for maintaining and improving both mental and physical health. Studies have shown that it is possible for us to change our physiology, including our mental state, by making adjustments to the way we breathe.</p>
        <p>One type of breathing exercise that has been shown to be effective in supporting relaxation and calm, increasing resilience to stress, and restoring balance to the nervous system is the practice of "slow-paced breathing," which is breathing at a steady rate that is slower than the normal rate of breathing. Resonance frequency breathing is slow-paced breathing at the specific breathing rate that elicits the greatest variability in one's heart rate (or heart rate variability, "HRV"). For most people, this rate is around 6 breaths per minute.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Allos Breath Pacer</strong> was developed specifically for the practice of slow-paced breathing at one's resonance frequency. The app offers a wide variety of music, soundscapes, and visual guides, and lets you customize the music and video to your ideal breathing rate.</p>
        <p>Our musical and visual guides are created by award-winning composers and designers to elevate your breathing practice to a deeper, more engaging experience. Find music for any mood and desired outcome, including relaxation, stress reduction, improved focus, and better sleep.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Allos Breath Pacer</strong> will be available soon for iOS and Android devices.</p>
