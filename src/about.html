        <p>Breathing practices, like meditation, can be challenging to maintain consistently. The <strong>Allos Breath Pacer</strong> is a music-guided pacer for slow breathing exercises that uses customizable music and animation to guide your practice in a more engaging way than traditional voices or repetitive cues.</p>
        <p>Breathing practices have been around for millennia in many forms and in many cultures. Research has begun to confirm the reported benefits of certain breathing practices for maintaining and improving both mental and physical health. Studies have shown that it is possible for us to change our physiology, including our mental state, by making adjustments to the way we breathe.</p>
        <p>One type of breathing exercise that has been shown to be effective in supporting relaxation and calm, increasing resilience to stress, and restoring balance to the nervous system is the practice of "slow-paced breathing," which is breathing at a steady rate that is slower than the normal rate of breathing. Resonance frequency breathing is slow-paced breathing at the specific breathing rate that elicits the greatest variability in one's heart rate (or heart rate variability, "HRV"). For most people, this rate is around 6 breaths per minute.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Allos Breath Pacer</strong> was developed specifically for the practice of slow-paced breathing at one's resonance frequency. Our musical and visual guides are created by award-winning composers and designers to elevate your breathing practice to a deeper, more engaging experience. Find music for any mood and intention, including relaxation, stress relief, focus, and sleep.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Allos Breath Pacer</strong> is available for download in the App Store and Google Play.</p>
