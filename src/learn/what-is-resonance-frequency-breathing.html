title: What is Resonance Frequency Breathing?
description: Resonance frequency breathing is an exercise that synchronizes natural rhythms of the body by breathing at a specific rate, usually between 4.5 and 7 breaths per minute, and takes advantage of the unique physiological properties of the cardiovascular system.

      <div class="article-content">        <p><em>Resonance frequency breathing is a practice of slow, paced breathing at a rate that matches the natural oscillations of an individual's heart rate. Breathing at this rate can support relaxation, mental focus, and autonomic nervous system regulation.</em></p>        <h2 class="article-h2">Key Points:</h2>
        <ul class="key-points-list">
          <li>Resonance frequency breathing is a specific type of slow-paced breathing.</li>
          <li>It involves breathing at the rate that maximizes heart rate variability (HRV).</li>
          <li>Most adults have a resonance frequency between 4.5 and 7 breaths per minute.</li>
          <li>A person's resonance frequency is unique and can be determined through testing.</li>
          <li>Breathing near 6 breaths per minute provides benefits for many people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resonance frequency breathing, also called 'resonant breathing,' or 'coherent breathing,' is a breathing exercise that takes advantage of the unique physiological properties of the cardiovascular system. Just like pushing a child on a swing with just the right rhythm can make the swing go higher and higher, when you breathe at your resonance frequency, you enhance the natural, healthy oscillations of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems.</p>
        <p>This breathing exercise is used to support relaxation, flow states, and to build resilience to stress. Strengthening the natural cycles of the heart and nervous system through a regular practice of resonance frequency breathing can support your natural ability to recover after intense workouts, mental focus, or emotionally stressful situations.</p>
        <h2 class="article-h2">How Is Resonance Frequency Determined?</h2>
        <p>A person's resonance frequency is typically identified through a test that measures heart rate variability while breathing at different slow breathing rates. The rate that produces the largest, smoothest oscillations in heart rate is considered the individual's resonance frequency. In clinical settings, this assessment is often performed as part of HRV biofeedback training, where real-time heart rate data is used to guide the breathing practice. While testing provides the most precise result, many people benefit from breathing at a steady pace of 5.5 to 6 breaths per minute.</p>
