title: What is Resonance Frequency Breathing?
description: Resonance frequency breathing is an exercise that synchronizes natural rhythms of the body by breathing at a specific rate, usually between 4.5 and 7 breaths per minute, and takes advantage of the unique physiological properties of the cardiovascular system.

      <div class="article-content">        <p><em>Resonance frequency breathing is a slow breathing practice that uses a specific breathing rate to align with the natural oscillations of the cardiovascular system. This rate, called a person's resonance frequency, typically falls around 6 breaths per minute in adults. Breathing at this rate can amplify heart rate variability and support autonomic nervous system regulation.</em></p>        <h2 class="article-h2">Key Points:</h2>

          <li>Resonance frequency breathing is a specific type of slow-paced breathing.</li>
          <li>It involves breathing at an individualized rate that maximizes heart rate variability.</li>
          <li>Most adults have a resonance frequency between 4.5 and 7 breaths per minute.</li>
          <li>Heart rate variability (HRV) is used to determine a person's resonance frequency.</li>
          <li>This practice is commonly used in HRV biofeedback and stress regulation.</li>
          <li>Breathing near 6 breaths per minute provides benefits for many people.</li>

        <p>Resonance frequency breathing, also called 'resonant breathing,' or 'coherent breathing,' is a breathing exercise that synchronizes natural rhythms of the body. It involves breathing at a specific breathing rate, which for most people is around 6 breaths per minute, and takes advantage of the unique physiological properties of the cardiovascular system. Breathing at one's resonance frequency can enhance the natural, healthy oscillations of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems.</p>
        <h2 class="article-h2">How Is Resonance Frequency Determined?</h2>
        <p>A person's resonance frequency is typically identified through a test that measures heart rate variability while breathing at different slow breathing rates. The rate that produces the largest, smoothest oscillations in heart rate is considered the individual's resonance frequency. In clinical settings, this assessment is often performed as part of HRV biofeedback training, where real-time heart rate data is used to guide breathing practice. While testing provides the most precise result, many people benefit from breathing at a steady pace of about six breaths per minute.</p>
